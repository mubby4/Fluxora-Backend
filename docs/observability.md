# Observability

## Prometheus scrape configuration

`GET /metrics` is protected by the same `ADMIN_API_KEY` Bearer token used by other admin routes. Prometheus scrape jobs must supply the token via the `Authorization` header.

### Environment variable

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_API_KEY` | Shared secret for admin and metrics access. Required — the endpoint returns `503` when unset. |

### Prometheus `scrape_configs` example

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: fluxora
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3000']
    authorization:
      type: Bearer
      credentials: <ADMIN_API_KEY value>
```

### Response codes

| Status | Cause |
|--------|-------|
| `200` | Valid token — metrics payload returned |
| `401` | Missing or malformed `Authorization` header |
| `403` | Token present but incorrect |
| `503` | `ADMIN_API_KEY` not configured on the server |

## Slow-query logging

Every repository method in `src/db/repositories/streamRepository.ts` is instrumented with a Prometheus histogram.

### Metric

```
fluxora_db_query_duration_seconds{repository="streamRepository",operation="upsertStream"} ...
```

| Label | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `repository` | `streamRepository` | Source repository |
| `operation` | `upsertStream`, `updateStream`, `getById`, `getByEvent`, `findWithCursor`, `find`, `countByStatus` | Method name |

**Buckets (seconds):** 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10

p99 SLO query:

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99, rate(fluxora_db_query_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
```

---

## Slow-Query Logging (SIEM Integration)

Every PostgreSQL query is timed. When duration ≥ `SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD_MS`, a structured OCSF log entry is emitted and a Prometheus counter is incremented.

## Server-Timing response header

Fluxora can return a W3C-compatible `Server-Timing` response header for the streams API so browser developer tools and ad-hoc debugging can see a compact latency breakdown without enabling the OpenTelemetry backend.

### How it works

- Middleware creates a request-scoped registry attached to `res.locals` when `SERVER_TIMING_ENABLED=true`.
- Route handlers record named phases for `db`, `stellar_rpc`, and `serialize` by pushing sanitized values into the registry.
- The final header is emitted once per response and contains only phase names and durations.

### Security guarantees

- The header contains no hostnames, query strings, URLs, or PII.
- Phase names are restricted to a safe token format and durations are rounded to milliseconds.
- The feature is disabled by default and adds negligible overhead when `SERVER_TIMING_ENABLED` is unset or false.

### Example

```http
Server-Timing: db;dur=12.5, serialize;dur=3.75
```

### Prometheus Counter

```
fluxora_db_slow_queries_total{table_hint="streams"} 3
```

## Server-Sent Events (SSE) observability
Counter name: `fluxora_db_slow_queries_total`  
Label: `table_hint` — the extracted table name (or `unknown`).  
Scraped at: `GET /metrics`

## Prometheus scrape configuration

`GET /metrics` is protected by the same `ADMIN_API_KEY` Bearer token used by other admin routes. Prometheus scrape jobs must supply the token via the `Authorization` header.

### Environment variable

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ADMIN_API_KEY` | Shared secret for admin and metrics access. Required — the endpoint returns `503` when unset. |

### Prometheus `scrape_configs` example

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: fluxora
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:3000']
    authorization:
      type: Bearer
      credentials: <ADMIN_API_KEY value>
```

### Response codes

| Status | Cause |
|--------|-------|
| `200` | Valid token — metrics payload returned |
| `401` | Missing or malformed `Authorization` header |
| `403` | Token present but incorrect |
| `503` | `ADMIN_API_KEY` not configured on the server |

## Runtime Performance Metrics

The application exposes fine-grained Node.js runtime health indicators to differentiate garbage collection pressure from event loop starvation during load spikes.

### Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| `fluxora_nodejs_heap_used_bytes` | Gauge | Node.js heap used size in bytes. |
| `fluxora_nodejs_heap_total_bytes` | Gauge | Node.js heap total size in bytes. |
| `fluxora_nodejs_external_bytes` | Gauge | Node.js external memory size in bytes. |
| `fluxora_nodejs_event_loop_lag_seconds` | Histogram | Event loop lag measured via a `setTimeout` probe. Buckets: 0.005 to 10 seconds. |

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `METRICS_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_MS` | `10000` | The interval in milliseconds at which to sample runtime metrics. |

### Alert Thresholding Strategy

- **Event Loop Lag**: Alert if p99 lag `> 1s` (indicates severe event loop starvation or long-running synchronous work).
- **Heap Pressure**: Alert if `fluxora_nodejs_heap_used_bytes` is consistently `> 85%` of `fluxora_nodejs_heap_total_bytes` over a sustained period (indicates GC thrashing).

## WebSocket Backpressure Gauges

When a single WebSocket subscriber stops reading from its socket, the kernel-level send buffer fills up and the hub eventually starts dropping frames or terminating the connection. Until that point, the global `BackpressureMetrics` only tell you *how often* drops happened, not *which* connection is consuming the most buffer.

The per-client gauges below expose `ws.bufferedAmount` directly so operators can pinpoint the offending peer before the hub escalates to drop/terminate.

### Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|-------------|------|--------|-------------|
| `fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes` | Gauge | `connection_id` (UUID v4) | Current `ws.bufferedAmount` per connected `/ws/streams` client, in bytes. Sampled every 5s by the hub's collector and rounded to non-negative integers. |
| `fluxora_ws_max_buffered_bytes` | Gauge | — | Maximum `ws.bufferedAmount` observed across all live clients at the most recent sample. Useful for dashboards: spikes here precede drops. |
| `fluxora_ws_slow_clients` | Gauge | — | Count of live clients whose `bufferedAmount` exceeds the slow threshold (default 1 MiB). |
| `fluxora_ws_broadcast_batch_flush_seconds` | Histogram | — | Age in seconds of the oldest event included in a micro-batched WebSocket broadcast flush. Bounded O(1) cardinality (zero labels). |

### Micro-Batch Broadcast Flush Latency

When WebSocket broadcast micro-batching (flush-window coalescing) is enabled via `flushWindowMs > 0`, events are held briefly to coalesce outbound socket frames. Operators tune `flushWindowMs` to balance network frame overhead against delivery latency.

`fluxora_ws_broadcast_batch_flush_seconds` records, per batch flush, the age (in seconds) of the oldest event included in that flush.

**Bucket layout (seconds):**  
`0.0001` (0.1ms), `0.0005` (0.5ms), `0.001` (1ms), `0.0025` (2.5ms), `0.005` (5ms), `0.01` (10ms), `0.025` (25ms), `0.05` (50ms), `0.1` (100ms), `0.25` (250ms), `0.5` (500ms), `1.0` (1s), `2.5` (2.5s), `5.0` (5s).

**Zero-Overhead Guarantee:**  
When micro-batching is disabled (default `flushWindowMs: 0`, single-event-per-frame mode), this metric is a complete no-op with zero runtime overhead and zero histogram observations recorded.

### Label cardinality and security

The only label is `connection_id`, which is a server-generated **UUID v4** produced in `StreamHub.onConnect` (`randomUUID()` from `node:crypto`). It is **never** derived from:

- The client IP address (`ws.remoteAddress`)
- The authenticated JWT subject or any JWT claim
- The `correlationId` header
- Any client-controlled input

Series for disconnected clients are explicitly removed via the prom-client `Gauge.remove(...)` API in `StreamHub.onDisconnect`, so the cardinality of the per-client gauge is bounded by **peak concurrent connections**, not by the total number of historical connections. This prevents:

- **Memory exhaustion** by an attacker that repeatedly connects/disconnects to inflate the metric label set.
- **PII leakage** through labels — even an attacker that controls the client cannot influence the label value.

The aggregated `fluxora_ws_max_buffered_bytes` and `fluxora_ws_slow_clients` carry no labels and contribute zero additional cardinality.

### Configuration

| StreamHub option | Default | Description |
|------------------|---------|-------------|
| `backpressureCollector.intervalMs` | `5000` | Poll interval. Set to `0` to disable the periodic collector entirely (gauge updates still happen during broadcast / send activity). |
| `backpressureCollector.slowThresholdBytes` | `1048576` (1 MiB) | Threshold above which a client is counted in `fluxora_ws_slow_clients`. |

### PromQL examples

Top-5 clients by current buffered bytes:

```promql
topk(5, fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes)
```

Any client approaching the terminate threshold (4 MiB), with 1 MB headroom:

```promql
max(fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes) > 4194304
```

Alert: more than 5 slow clients sustained over 5 minutes:

```promql
fluxora_ws_slow_clients > 5
```

### Thresholding strategy

- **`fluxora_ws_slow_clients > 0` for > 2 min**: investigate the highest entries of `topk(5, fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes)` and look for one or two clients with `correlation_id` entries repeated in the structured `ws_backpressure` warning logs.
- **`max(fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes) > 4 MiB`** (terminate threshold): one or more clients are about to be force-closed by the hub. Operators can proactively identify the offending connection via `topk(1, fluxora_ws_backpressure_buffered_bytes)`.
- **`fluxora_ws_max_buffered_bytes` rising without `fluxora_ws_slow_clients` rising**: one client is filling up but stays below the slow threshold — still worth checking `topk(1, ...)` to confirm it's not unbounded.

### Affected source files

- `src/metrics/wsBackpressure.ts` — gauge definitions + collector helpers
- `src/ws/hub.ts` — starts the collector and removes the per-client series on disconnect
- `tests/ws/hub.perClientGauge.test.ts` — bounded-cardinality / rise-then-clear assertions

## WebSocket Subscription Cardinality Gauge

A single stream with an unusually large subscriber count can drive disproportionate broadcast fan-out, consuming CPU and network bandwidth while increasing backpressure risk for every other stream. The subscription cardinality gauge reports the subscriber count for the top-N most-subscribed streams so operators can identify hot streams before they cause incidents.

### Metric

| Metric Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|-------------|------|--------|-------------|
| `fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count` | Gauge | `stream_id` (application-assigned stream identifier) | Subscriber count for the top-N WebSocket streams by fan-out size. Only the N most-subscribed streams are reported (default N = 20). |

### Label cardinality and security

The `stream_id` label is the opaque stream identifier assigned by the application. It does not contain PII, client IPs, JWT subjects, or any user-controlled data.

Cardinality is bounded by `DEFAULT_WS_STREAM_CARDINALITY_TOP_N` (20) — at most 20 time-series are emitted at any point. The collector sorts streams by subscriber count descending, keeps the top N, and explicitly removes stale series for streams that drop below the N-th rank between collection cycles. This prevents:

- **Unbounded label growth** when many low-subscriber streams exist — only the top 20 are exposed.
- **Stale series** lingering after a stream's subscribers leave — stale labels are cleaned up on the next collection cycle.

An attacker cannot inflate Prometheus memory by creating many streams with a handful of subscribers each, because only the top-N are ever exposed regardless of how many total streams exist.

### Configuration

| Constant | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DEFAULT_WS_STREAM_CARDINALITY_TOP_N` | `20` | Maximum number of streams reported by the gauge. Exported from `src/metrics/wsBackpressure.ts`. |

### PromQL examples

Top-5 streams by subscriber count:

```promql
topk(5, fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count)
```

Alert: any single stream with more than 500 subscribers (potential hot-stream):

```promql
fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count > 500
```

Total subscribers across all top-N streams (approximation of broadcast fan-out):

```promql
sum(fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count)
```

### Thresholding strategy

- **`max(fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count) > 500` for > 5 min**: investigate the identified hot stream. High fan-out magnifies the cost of every broadcast event — one slow client can trigger backpressure for all other subscribers on that stream.
- **`topk(1, fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count)` divergence from `sum(fluxora_ws_stream_subscriber_count)`**: one stream dominates the total subscriber count, indicating fan-out concentration risk.
- **Correlation with `fluxora_ws_slow_clients` rising**: a hot stream with slow clients compounds backpressure; identify the stream from the cardinality gauge and the slow clients from the per-client backpressure gauge.

### Affected source files

- `src/metrics/wsBackpressure.ts` — `wsStreamSubscriberCount` gauge definition + `collectStreamSubscriberCardinality` helper
- `src/ws/hub.ts` — `_getStreamSubscriptions()` accessor exposing the internal `streamSubscriptions` map
- `tests/ws/hub.subscriptionCardinality.test.ts` — top-N cap, stale-series removal, empty-hub, and reset assertions

## Authentication Latency Histograms

Auth runs on every protected request path. When the JWT verifier, revocation-store lookup, or API-key store becomes a bottleneck, these histograms give a distribution view (p50/p95/p99) and a split by success/failure — without leaking credential material.

### Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|-------------|------|--------|-------------|
| `fluxora_auth_jwt_verify_duration_seconds` | Histogram | `outcome` (`success` \| `failure`) | Time spent in `verifyToken()` (the cryptographic verify only — does NOT include revocation check or schema parse). Recorded by `src/middleware/auth.ts`. |
| `fluxora_auth_apikey_lookup_duration_seconds` | Histogram | `outcome` (`success` \| `failure`) | Time spent in API-key lookups. Recorded by `src/lib/apiKey.ts::isValidApiKey` and `src/middleware/adminAuth.ts::requireAdminAuth`. |

### Bucket layout

The bucket boundaries are intentionally bounded and tuned for each call site:

```text
fluxora_auth_jwt_verify_duration_seconds:        0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1
fluxora_auth_apikey_lookup_duration_seconds:     0.0001, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05
```

Range rationale:

- JWT verify buckets span 1 ms → 1 s. The measurement covers `verifyToken()` alone; the trailing revocation-check and schema-parse steps are intentionally excluded so an `outcome=success` observation reflects only successful cryptographic verification. A 401 caused by a downstream revocation hit or token-schema mismatch will appear as `outcome=success` on this histogram and is observable separately through the HTTP error-rate counter.
- API-key lookup buckets span 100 µs → 50 ms because the in-memory store does a SHA-256 + `timingSafeEqual`, but a future DB-backed store (tracked separately) would shift the distribution to the millisecond range.

### Security & label-cardinality guarantees

The label set is intentionally restricted to a single `outcome` label. The metrics must **never** carry credential material. The following labels are forbidden both now and in future iterations:

### Subscriber callback errors

When a live SSE subscriber callback throws, Fluxora keeps fan-out isolated (other subscribers still run) but emits both:

1. a structured error log
2. a Prometheus counter

**Metric**

- Name: `fluxora_sse_subscriber_errors_total`
- Type: Counter
- Label: `reason` (bounded enum)

This metric increments on thrown subscriber callbacks.

**Security**

SSE payloads and other stream-level data are not included in the log/metric labels (only `streamId` is logged; the payload is not logged).


## Webhook Circuit Breaker Metrics

Outbound webhook delivery uses a per-consumer-URL circuit breaker to avoid hammering failing endpoints.
The `fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total` counter tracks every state change so operators
can build dashboards and alert on consumer endpoint degradation.

### `fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total`

A Prometheus **Counter** that increments on every circuit-breaker state transition.

| Label | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `from_state` | `closed`, `open`, `half-open` | State before the transition |
| `to_state` | `closed`, `open`, `half-open` | State after the transition |
| `consumer_hash` | 16-char hex string | SHA-256 of the consumer URL, truncated to 16 hex characters |

**Cardinality bounds:**
The `consumer_hash` label is a fixed 16-character hex digest derived from `SHA-256(consumer_url)`.
The raw URL is **never** exposed as a label, preventing:
- Unbounded cardinality from arbitrary customer endpoint URLs
- PII or credential leakage through metric labels

Both the Redis-backed (`RedisWebhookCircuitBreakerStore`) and in-memory-fallback
(`InMemoryWebhookCircuitBreakerStore`) code paths emit this metric, so counters remain
accurate during a Redis outage.

### State machine

```
closed ──(threshold reached)──▸ open
 open  ──(reset period elapsed)──▸ half-open
half-open ──(probe succeeds)──▸ closed
half-open ──(probe fails)──▸ open
```

### PromQL examples

**Total transitions into `open` state** (circuit breaker tripping rate):

```promql
sum(rate(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{to_state="open"}[5m])) by (consumer_hash)
```

**Breakers currently in `open` state** (approximation — count recent open→half-open and closed→open transitions minus recoveries):

```promql
sum(increase(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{to_state="open"}[1h])) by (consumer_hash)
-
sum(increase(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{from_state="open"}[1h])) by (consumer_hash)
```

**Half-open probes succeeding vs failing** (recovery health):

```promql
sum(rate(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{from_state="half-open",to_state="closed"}[5m]))
sum(rate(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{from_state="half-open",to_state="open"}[5m]))
```

### Alerting rules

```yaml
groups:
  - name: webhook-circuit-breaker
    rules:
      - alert: WebhookCircuitBreakerOpenRateHigh
        expr: sum(rate(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{to_state="open"}[5m])) by (consumer_hash) > 0.1
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: warning
        annotations:
          summary: "Webhook circuit breaker tripping frequently for consumer {{ $labels.consumer_hash }}"

      - alert: WebhookCircuitBreakerStuckOpen
        expr: increase(fluxora_webhook_circuit_breaker_transitions_total{from_state="half-open",to_state="open"}[1h]) > 3
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Webhook consumer {{ $labels.consumer_hash }} circuit breaker repeatedly re-opening — endpoint may be down"
```

### WebSocket Micro-Batching Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Description | Buckets / Labels |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
